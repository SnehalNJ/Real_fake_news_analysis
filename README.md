**Real and Fake News Analysis**

This project focuses on distinguishing between real and fake news articles using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The analysis is conducted on a dataset consisting of around 20,000 articles categorized as either real or fake. Key components of the project include:  
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.  
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualization techniques such as histograms, bar plots, density plots, and word clouds for understanding the data distribution.  
NLP Techniques: N-gram analysis and sentiment analysis to extract meaningful insights from the text  
Classification Models: Implementing and comparing multiple machine learning models to classify news articles.  
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate models.  
Deployment: The project is deployed using Streamlit to create an interactive UI.  
This repository contains the code, datasets, and necessary documentation to replicate the project.
